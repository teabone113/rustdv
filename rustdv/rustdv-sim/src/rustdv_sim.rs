//! # rustdv-sim
//!
//! The cocotb-analog core (design-doc §4): a bespoke single-threaded
//! executor driven by simulator callbacks (D4.1 — not tokio), the task
//! model, the trigger inventory, typed signal handles with buffered
//! writes, `Clock`, and sim-aware `Event`/`Lock`/`Queue`.
//!
//! Control-flow contract (§4.1): a GPI/VPI callback fires → subscribed
//! tasks are woken → the run queue is drained to exhaustion
//! ([`Executor::run_until_idle`]) → control returns to the simulator.

// Test executables need vpi_* symbol definitions (the simulator provides
// them for the real cdylib) — see rustdv-vpi-stubs.
