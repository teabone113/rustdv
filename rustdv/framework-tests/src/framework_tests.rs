//! Targeted simulator tests for rustdv itself (test-plan §3).
//!
//! ```text
//! framework-tests/run.sh              every test
//! framework-tests/run.sh trig         one group
//! ```
//!
//! **These are not book examples.** The 21 `sim-ch*` regression entries are
//! the end-to-end tier: each proves a chapter's testbench compiles, runs on
//! Icarus and reports `REGRESSION: PASS`. They are good tests and they cannot
//! tell you *which* rule broke. These can — each one exercises a single
//! mechanism against a real simulator and fails with that mechanism's name.
//!
//! Everything here needs a simulator, which is the only reason it is not in
//! `cargo test`. The rule is in `rustdv_sim::testing::block_on`: a test that
//! awaits simulated time or touches a signal belongs here; everything else —
//! the ConfigDb, the factory, port binding, the analysis broadcast, the whole
//! sequencer handshake — is a `#[cfg(test)]` module beside the code it tests
//! and runs in milliseconds.
//!
//! ## Naming is the interface
//!
//! Each module prefixes its test names, and the regression selects a group
//! with `RUSTDV_TESTCASE`. So `sim-triggers` and `sim-concurrency` are
//! separate lines in the regression report but share one build and one
//! elaboration. The long `callback_stress_` group is selected only by its
//! dedicated Verilator regression; an unfiltered manual run uses its short
//! default cycle count.
//!
//! | prefix | module | what it pins down |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `trig_` | [`triggers`] | `Timer`, edges, phase order, RAII deregistration |
//! | `clock_` | [`clocks`] | `Clock` produces the period it was asked for |
//! | `sig_` | [`signals`] | handle read/write, widths, X/Z, write scheduling |
//! | `conc_` | [`concurrency`] | the D82 family, against real time |
//! | `elab_` | [`elaboration`] | unconnected ports fail before the run phase |
//! | `runner_` | [`runner`] | timeouts, `expect_error`, per-test freshness |
//! | `sv_types_` | `sv_types` (Verilator feature) | real/string writes and aggregate members |
//! | `callback_stress_` | [`callback_lifecycle`] | fired one-shot handles reach an RSS plateau |
//! | `stable_point_` | [`triggers`] | synchronous service at settled ReadOnly |
//!
//! The DUT is `hdl/probe.sv`: a clock, signals of known widths that nothing
//! drives, and one counter so an edge trigger has something to trigger on.

// The `cargo test` binary links this crate's rlib and so needs the `vpi_*`
// symbols defined, even though the registry smoke test never calls them. The simulator provides them for the real
// cdylib; `rustdv-vpi-stubs` provides panicking placeholders for the test
// build, which is what turns "this test secretly needed a simulator" into a
// loud failure instead of a silent one.
